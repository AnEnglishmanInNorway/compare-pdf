The requirements.txt file was generated by
	pip3 install pipreqs
	pip3 install pip-tools
	pipreqs --savepath=requirements.in && pip-compile
based on what I found at https://stackoverflow.com/questions/31684375/automatically-create-file-requirements-txt/65728461#65728461
I used that to create my comppdfenv environment, but it seemed that some things were missing:
	PyMuPDF==1.25.5
	setuptools==75.8.0
	wheel==0.45.1
Even after I added those by hand, it still seemed to be necessary to run
	pip3 install pymupdf opencv-python

Can't say I understand what is happening, but now compare-pdf runs in the virtual environment.
